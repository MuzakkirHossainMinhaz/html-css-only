# HTML and CSS Beginner Projects
This repository contains all of my beginner-level HTML and CSS projects that were not added to my portfolio website. These web pages were designed during the early stages of my web development journey and are intended for educational purposes.

## Projects Included
The following projects are included in this repository:

1. **About Bangladesh :** This is a very basic web page that is suitable for beginners. It does not require any advanced knowledge or programming skills. [preview](https://about-bangladesh.netlify.app/)<br>
2. **Developer Portfolio v1.0 :** This is a very basic landing porfolio page that is suitable for beginners. It does not require any advanced knowledge or programming skills.  [preview](https://developer-portfolio-v1.netlify.app/)<br>
3. **Developer Portfolio v2.0 :** This web page uses Fontawesome icons. In order to use these icons, the page requires the Fontawesome CDN (Content Delivery Network) to be linked in its HTML code. This is because the Fontawesome icons are not included as part of standard HTML or CSS, and need to be loaded separately from the Fontawesome servers using their CDN.

4. **Programming Hero Team :** This web page is partially responsive. This means that while the page has some elements that adjust to different screen sizes and devices, not all elements are optimized for different viewports. [preview](https://phero-team.netlify.app/)<br>
5. **Gaius Julius Caesar's Portfolio :** This landing web page is fully responsive, meaning it is designed to adapt and look good on a variety of devices and screen sizes. In addition to HTML and CSS, this page uses the Bootstrap framework to create a responsive design. The page also uses icons from the Cloudflare CDN, which allows for fast and reliable delivery of these icons to the page. [preview](https://simple-portfolio-julius.netlify.app/)<br>
