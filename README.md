# HTML and CSS Beginner Projects
This repository contains all of my beginner-level HTML and CSS projects that were not added to my portfolio website. These web pages were designed during the early stages of my web development journey and are intended for educational purposes.

## Projects Included
The following projects are included in this repository:

Project 1: [About Bangladesh](https://about-bangladesh.netlify.app/)<br>

Project 3: [Programming Hero Team](https://phero-team.netlify.app/)<br>

Each project is contained in its own folder and includes all necessary files and assets. The projects are designed to be easy to follow along with and can be used as a learning resource for those new to web development.
